/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data,
 * specifically their user profile and their savings entries. All data is nested under the /users/{userId}
 * path to simplify access control.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}: Stores individual savings entries for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user document.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own savings entries.
 * - No user listing is allowed to protect user privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Savings documents contain a 'userId' field that MUST match the path. This is essential to avoid costly 'get()' operations in the security rules.
