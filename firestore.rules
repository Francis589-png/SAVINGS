/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.

 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Users can only create their own profile, and profiles can only be read by the user or database administrators (not implemented).
 *   - Savings entries are strictly owned by the user; only the user can create, read, update, or delete their own savings entries.
 *   - No user listing is allowed.
