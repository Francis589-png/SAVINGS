/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the CurrencyTrack application.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, and each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}: Stores individual savings entries for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own savings entries.
 * - Listing other users' savings is disallowed.
 * - Denormalization is used to improve security rules performance and prevent unwanted `get()` calls. Specifically, each `Saving` document includes a `userId` field.
