/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for savings entries.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}/savingsEntries/{savingsEntryId}, ensuring
 * that only the authenticated user can access their own savings data.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}/savingsEntries/{savingsEntryId}
 *   - userId: The unique identifier for the user.
 *   - savingsEntryId: The unique identifier for the savings entry.
 *   - SavingsEntry data (amount, currency, usdAmount, entryDate)
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Users can only access their own savings entries.
 * - Listing savings entries is restricted to the owner.
 * - The schema of the data is not strictly validated in this prototyping phase,
 *   but ownership is enforced based on the path and document contents.
 * - Data required for authorization decisions (ownership) are denormalized onto the
 *   SavingsEntry documents by way of the path.
