/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only
 * access their own data. Authorization decisions are made independently at each
 * level of the data hierarchy.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, with 'userId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}: Stores individual savings entries for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own savings entries.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Ownership is enforced at the path level, with the 'userId' in the path being
 *   the sole determinant of access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Each `Saving` document includes the `userId` to allow rules to validate ownership
 *   without additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data (savings entries) is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path,
 *   preventing accidental public exposure and simplifying list operations.
