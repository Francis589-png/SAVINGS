/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for savings data. Users can only access their own savings entries.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - All user data is stored under /users/{userId}.
 * - Savings entries are stored under /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list savings entries under their own user ID.
 * - Data consistency is enforced between the path and the document's internal userId field.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Saving' documents include the 'userId' to avoid using get() in security rules to verify ownership.
