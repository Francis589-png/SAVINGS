/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for both user profiles and savings entries.
 * Only authenticated users can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, where {userId} corresponds to the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}: Stores savings entries for each user, where {userId} corresponds to the Firebase Auth UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents and savings entries.
 * - List operations are only allowed for a user's own savings entries.
 * - No public access is granted to any user data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Savings documents include a `userId` field to enable direct ownership checks in security rules without requiring additional `get()` calls.
