/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for savings entries. Each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, with 'userId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/savingsEntries/{savingId}: Stores individual savings entries, with 'userId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list savings entries under their own user ID.
 * - Data shapes are not strictly enforced to allow for rapid prototyping. However, relational integrity is enforced on key authorization fields.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Savings documents include the `userId` to enable ownership checks without additional `get()` calls.
