/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only
 * access their own data. Authorization decisions are based on the authenticated
 * user's UID and the document paths. Data schema is not strictly enforced to allow
 * for prototyping flexibility, but relational integrity is maintained by validating
 * user IDs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with 'userId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/savingsEntries/{savingId}: Stores savings entries for each user,
 *   nested under their UID. Each entry includes a 'userId' field for authorization.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own savings entries.
 * - User listing is not explicitly allowed, defaulting to denial.
 * - The 'userId' field in 'Saving' documents is immutable to prevent ownership changes.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Saving` documents include the `userId` to avoid using `get()` in security rules
 *   to verify ownership. This improves performance and simplifies the rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Savings entries are stored in a subcollection of the user's document, ensuring that
 *   each user can only access their own savings entries.
