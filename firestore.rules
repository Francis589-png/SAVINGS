/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only access their own data. It prioritizes Authorization Independence by denormalizing user IDs directly into documents, avoiding costly `get()` calls within rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with 'userId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}: Stores savings entries for each user, including a denormalized 'userId' field.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly denied (no rule allows it).
 * - Savings entries are secured via path-based ownership and a denormalized `userId` field within the document.
