/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only
 * access their own data. Authorization Independence is achieved by denormalizing
 * user IDs on subcollection documents, avoiding costly `get()` calls in rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, with 'userId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}: Stores savings entries for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user documents and savings entries.
 * - Public listing of users or savings is disallowed.
 * - Data validation is minimal during this prototyping phase, focusing on ownership.
 * - Immutability is enforced for the userId on Savings documents after creation.
 * - All write operations are protected against acting on non-existent documents.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'Saving' entity includes a 'userId' field, mirroring the user's UID. This
 * denormalization allows direct rule-based authorization without additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * All user-specific data is stored under the /users/{userId} path, clearly separating
 * data access concerns and preventing accidental public exposure.
