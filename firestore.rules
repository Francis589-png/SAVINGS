/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and savings entries.
 * Users can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data. The userId must match the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}: Stores savings entries for each user.  The userId must match the Firebase Auth UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user profile.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own savings entries.
 * - No public listing of user profiles or savings entries is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Savings documents include the userId to allow direct ownership checks without additional `get() calls.
