/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, where {userId} matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}: Stores savings entries for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profiles and savings entries.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Authorization independence is achieved by denormalizing the userId into each saving document.
