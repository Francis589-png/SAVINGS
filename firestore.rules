/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for savings entries
 * nested under user profiles. Each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/savingsEntries/{savingId}: Stores individual savings entries
 *   for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list savings entries under their own profile.
 * - Savings entries include a denormalized 'userId' field for authorization independence.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototype phase, focusing on
 *   authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Saving` document includes the `userId` to avoid using `get()` in
 *   security rules to verify ownership. This allows rules to validate
 *   ownership directly against the document's `userId` field.
