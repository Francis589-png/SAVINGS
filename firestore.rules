/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CurrencyTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Users can only
 * access their own data, preventing unauthorized access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. 'userId' must match the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}: Stores savings entries for a specific user. The 'userId' in the path must match the Firebase Auth UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read, create, update, and delete their own user documents and savings entries.
 * - Listing savings entries is restricted to the owner of the user ID in the path.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase, focusing on ownership and relational integrity.
 * - Denormalization: Savings documents contain the userId to avoid get() calls in rules.
