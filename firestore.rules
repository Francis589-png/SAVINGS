/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the CurrencyTrack application.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, with the 'userId' corresponding to the Firebase Auth UID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/savings/{savingId}: Stores individual savings entries. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own savings entries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. No cross-user access is allowed.
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Data validation is minimal to allow for rapid prototyping and schema iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Saving' documents include the 'userId' field, which is a denormalized copy of the parent document ID.
 *   This avoids the need for expensive 'get()' operations in the security rules to verify ownership.
 *   The 'userId' field in a saving document must match the 'userId' in the path.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private data (user profiles and savings entries) is stored under the /users/{userId} path.
